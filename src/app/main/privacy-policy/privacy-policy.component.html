<h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>

When using processors, we only pass on personal data of our customers based on a valid processing contract. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint processing is concluded.

The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.
<h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>

You have the right to have data that we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.

If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
If you have lodged an objection under Art. 21(1) DSGVO, a balance must be struck between your and our interests. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.

Cookies necessary for the electronic communication process, the provision of certain functions you desire (e.g., for the shopping cart function), or the optimization of the website (e.g., cookies for measuring web audience) are stored based on Art. 6(1)(f) DSGVO unless another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing necessary cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services.

You can set your browser to inform you about the setting of cookies and to allow cookies only in individual cases, to exclude the acceptance of cookies for specific cases or in general, and to activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.

The processing of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) DSGVO if your request is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective handling of the requests addressed to us (Art. 6(1)(f) DSGVO) or on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) DSGVO) if this has been requested; the consent can be revoked at any time.
